The finite-state machine is a Python/Flask web service running on Heroku. When initialized, the drone automatically connects with the smart contract and begins autonomous operations. The bot code communicates with the [FedEx APIs](https://www.fedex.com/en-ca/resources-tools/api.html) usign HTTP.

We wrote a finite-state machine that extends the artificial intelligence of the [FedEx SameDay bot](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=fedex+sameday+bot). It turns the drone into self-owning infrastructure that earns FeX tokens by making deliveries and using those tokens to pay for its maintenance. The drone AI depends on the [FedEx APIs](https://www.fedex.com/en-ca/resources-tools/api.html) to validate delivery jobs sent by users of the marketplace. The drone is programmed to manage its own repairs. The drone determines when it needs maintenance, and can decide to hire a technician from the FedEx Economy.  The drone uses the [FedEx APIs](https://www.fedex.com/en-ca/resources-tools/api.html) to locate a nearby FedEx office and arrange to meet the technician for repairs.
